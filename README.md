# Dream Scene #

<img src="/screenshot.png" width="500" height="300">

Dream Scene is a simple Android TV app that acts very similar to the default screensaver that displays nature images along with the clock and a Chromecast hint. The main difference being that this app uses 4k images targeted at Nvidia Shield on 4k displays.

## Setup ##

To enable the service, go into the Daydream section of settings and choose Dream Scene instead of Backdrop.

## Adding More Wallpapers ##

Dream Scene pulls all images from the JSONArray in ```backgrounds.json``` when it starts. This means that to add new images, you don't need to update the app since the values aren't hardcoded. Feel free to add more to the file and submit a pull request and I will check them out and approve them if I like them. Images must be 3840x2160 resolution.
